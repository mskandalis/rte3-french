# French version of the English RTE-3 dataset (RTE3)

The present RTE3-FR dataset is the French translation of the Textual Entailment English dataset used in the RTE-3 Challenge (https://nlp.stanford.edu/RTE3-pilot/).

Like its English counterpart, the French RTE-3 dataset is composed of a development set and a test set, each containing 800 T/H pairs.
